# WaitMate Discord Bot

## Overview

WaitMate is a Discord bot designed to streamline the moderation process on Discord servers, offering a simple and fair queue system for users and supporters. It comes handy especially in environments where users are required to wait in line for their turn to be attended to by a supporter.

## Features

- **Fair Queue System**: Ensures users are attended to on a first-come, first-serve basis, promoting a fair and efficient system.
- **Special Attention Handling**: The bot recognizes users with a "@" in their name and can differentiate between those who are waiting for specific moderation and those who are open to being attended by any supporter.
- **Automatic User Moving**: Supporters can use the "/next" command to automatically move the next user in the queue to their channel.
- **Easy-to-use Commands**: Simplified commands such as "/next" make it easy for supporters to perform actions without manual efforts.
